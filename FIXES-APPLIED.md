# All Fixes Applied ‚úÖ

## Summary

Your HEAW-2025 website is now fully configured to work when opened directly from File Explorer and when deployed to gla.ac.in!

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Errors
**Problem:** Opening HTML files directly caused CORS policy errors  
**Solution:** Changed Vite build configuration to use IIFE format and relative paths  
**File:** `vite.config.js`

### 2. Root Element Not Found
**Problem:** Script tried to run before DOM element existed  
**Solution:** Moved script tag from `<head>` to end of `<body>`  
**File:** `fix-dist.js`

### 3. React Router 404 Errors
**Problem:** BrowserRouter doesn't work with file:// protocol  
**Solution:** Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter  
**File:** `src/App.jsx`

### 4. Missing Logo Files
**Problem:** IUCCA_Logo[1].png not loading  
**Solution:** Added auto-copy of public folder files to dist during build  
**File:** `fix-dist.js`

## üéØ Build Process

Now when you run `npm run build`, it automatically:
1. Builds your React app
2. Copies all public assets (logos, icons, etc.)
3. Removes module type from script tags
4. Moves scripts to end of body
5. Creates file:// compatible output

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. `vite.config.js` - Changed base to './' and IIFE format
2. `src/App.jsx` - Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter
3. `fix-dist.js` - Post-build script to fix HTML and copy files
4. `package.json` - Updated build script to run fix-dist.js

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Local Testing:
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to `dist` folder
3. Double-click `index.html`
4. Website opens without errors!

### For Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:8081

### For Production Build:

```
Files ready in `dist/` folder

### For Deployment:

## üìù Notes

- The website now uses HashRouter, so URLs will have `#` in them
- Example: `file:///path/index.html#/` instead of `file:///path/index.html/`
- This is normal and works perfectly for both local and server use
